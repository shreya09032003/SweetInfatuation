SweetInfatuation 💕

Welcome to SweetInfatuation! 🌟

As a budding developer, I crafted this charming little project during Valentine’s week to spread some love and joy. While it might not be the most complex or technically advanced project, it’s packed with cuteness and warmth. Think of it as a digital love note wrapped in a pink bow! 🎀

🌹 What’s SweetInfatuation?

SweetInfatuation is a playful, interactive website designed to bring a smile to you and your special someone.

💌 What’s Inside?

A Fun Question: “Will you go out on a date with me?” with interactive Yes and No buttons.

Tricky “No” Button: Try to click it if you can! (Hint: It’s on the move.) If you succeed, you get virtual chocolates! 🍫

Date Picker: Select a date and get a sweet confirmation message.

Cute GIFs & Pink Theme: A charming, friendly design perfect for the occasion.
